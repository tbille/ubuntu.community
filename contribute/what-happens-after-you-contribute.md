title: What happens after you contribute?
description:

First, if youâ€™ve made it to this page because you have contributed and youâ€™re thinking about what happens next, CONGRATULATIONS! Thatâ€™s great, you are an open source contributor and have taken a step towards becoming an Ubuntu member or contributor. We hope you keep contributing :)

Of course, there are lots of different projects in and around Ubuntu and itâ€™s unreasonable to think each and every single one of them are super active and ready for more contributors. We hope itâ€™ll get there, but thatâ€™s a forever goal. After you make a contribution, one of these four things happens:

## ðŸ˜­ You donâ€™t get a response

Hopefully you checked the project for signs of activity before making a contribution. Even on an active project, however, itâ€™s possible that your contribution wonâ€™t get a response.

If you havenâ€™t gotten a response in over a week, itâ€™s fair to politely respond in that same thread, asking someone for a review. If you know the name of the right person to review your contribution, you can @-mention them in that thread.

Donâ€™t reach out to that person privately; remember that public communication is vital to open source projects.

If you make a polite bump and still nobody responds, itâ€™s possible that nobody will respond, ever. Itâ€™s not a great feeling, but donâ€™t let that discourage you. Itâ€™s happened to everyone! There are many possible reasons why you didnâ€™t get a response, including personal circumstances that may be out of your control. Try to find another project or way to contribute. If anything, this is a good reason not to invest too much time in making a contribution before other community members are engaged and responsive.

## ðŸš§ Someone requests changes to your contribution

Itâ€™s common that youâ€™ll be asked to make changes to your contribution, whether thatâ€™s feedback on the scope of your idea, or changes to your code.

When someone requests changes, be responsive. Theyâ€™ve taken the time to review your contribution. Offering to contribute something and then walking away is usually bad form. If you donâ€™t know how to make the changes they suggest, research the problem or ask for help. If you donâ€™t want to do what they are asking, politely respond with your reasoning adn see what they say. If your visions donâ€™t line up for what youâ€™re contributing to, thatâ€™s okay, and you can find somewhere else to contribute your valuable time.

If you donâ€™t have time to work on the issue anymore (for example, if the conversation has been going on for months, and your circumstances have changed), let the maintainer know so theyâ€™re not expecting a response. Someone else may be happy to take over.

## ðŸ‘Ž Your contribution doesnâ€™t get accepted

Your contribution may or may not be accepted in the end. Hopefully you didnâ€™t put too much work into it already. If youâ€™re not sure why it wasnâ€™t accepted, itâ€™s perfectly reasonable to ask the maintainer for feedback and clarification. Ultimately, however, youâ€™ll need to respect that this is their decision. Donâ€™t argue or get hostile. Youâ€™re always welcome to fork and work on your own version if you disagree!

## ðŸŽ‰ Your contribution gets accepted

Hooray! Youâ€™ve successfully made your contribution!
