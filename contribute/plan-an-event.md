title: Plan an event for Linux/Ubuntu
description: Communities are vast, with lots of people doing lots of different things. So it's important to bring people together for a sense of belonging and comradery. In person or virtual events are the  best way to do this. Anyone who runs an event is contributing to the soul of the community.
