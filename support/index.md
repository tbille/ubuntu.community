Sometimes, in the vast, sprawling network of all things Ubuntu, people need help. Regularly, and rightly, people run into problems or bugs or issues that they don’t know how to fix. No one in the Ubuntu community knows it all. So, where do you go if you have a question? Where do you go if your desktop bugs out? If it crashes? Or if your brand new VR headset won’t work?

## Technical support

If you’re looking for technical support, there are a few places to consider:

### [Ask Ubuntu](https://askubuntu.com/)

A StackOverFlow site for giving and receiving technical support from the Ubutnu community.

We recommend you read their [help Center page](https://askubuntu.com/help), for guidance on how to ask your question in a way that stays on topic, and gets you the most relevant response.

You may even find your question answered. Check out the [top questions page](https://askubuntu.com/?tab=month) for a sample of technical support topics that the community is interested in this month.

### [Ubuntu Forums](https://ubuntuforums.org/)

A place for asking and answering technical questions that require a discussion.

We recommend using the forums to ask and answer long form questions that might not have a single answer, where other people can test things out and tell you their experience with a problem

But be careful, the forums are typically less up to date than Ask Ubuntu and so threads that date back may no longer be accurate.

### [Canonical documentation](docs.ubuntu.com)

The 'official' documentation for Ubuntu and Ubuntu associated projects are maintained by [Canonical](canonical.com), the publishers of Ubuntu.

We recommend looking through this documentation if you're looking for reference material, to learn more about the technology, or to look for tutorials and guides produced by the developers of whatever you're looking for.

### [The Ubuntu Wiki](wiki.ubuntu.com)

Over the years, for better or worse, vast shelves worth of documentation has been collected by the community and by Ubuntu members. Meeting minutes, technical blue prints, guides, tutorials, updates, and on. It's collected on the wiki. Bare with it, it's not the fastest.

## Project support

If you’re more looking to for help starting something new, or looking for contributors to your new project or have a problem with Ubuntu but it’s not really technical, this is what you’re looking for:
