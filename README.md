# ubuntu dot community üëê

Welcome to the Ubuntu dot community repo. Good to see ya.  Here we centralise website contributions to ubuntu.community. Anything from copy updates to full blown 
extra special new pages. The main objective is to help members of the Ubuntu community collaborate and contribute to general ‚Äòon-boarding‚Äô type documentation.  

** A logo of some kind should go here **

## Steps to dot community :signal_strength:

### 1. Have a look around [ubuntu.community](https://ubuntu.community) :house_with_garden:
  
  The website this is all about. It is the road map (not related to the actual Roadmap) between landmarks in the Ubuntu community.

### 2. Report a bug on the website :bug: 

  At the bottom of each and every page is a link to report a bug on the site, this is currently not working. When someone make it work though it will simply take you to the new issues seciton of this very repo where you can indeed report a bug. The 'bug' label should already exist so make sure you use that üêõ

### 3. Have a suggestion for something you think we should feature üñºÔ∏è
  Then let us know! Let us know damn it!!! You have a few options, since you're here reading this though your best option is probably to create a new issue in the repo with the 'enhancment' label. Leave a description of what you're thinking and maybe a plan forward, and we'll take a look. Of course, the alternative to that is to fork the repo and just try and contribute the future staight away ... üëÄ
  
### 4. Looking to contribute something brand new üë∂
   Then do it! Fork away, build away, and pull request. We'll see it and start the discussion or merge as necessary üòä

### 5. Participate in the Ubuntu Community üí¨
