So you’re a new Ubuntu user? Maybe even a _new_ Ubuntu user? And you’re wondering; what else is there? How can I get involved in this ‘Ubuntu Community’ thing? Well. Let us tell you.

> Disclaimer: If you’re here looking to ask a support question, let me guide you to [our support page](https://ubuntu.community/support) instead. If you’re looking for an Ubuntu download button, let me guide you over there. This page is for users looking to _get involved_ in Ubuntu.

## Discourse

The Ubuntu Discourse is the aptly named Ubuntu Community hub. If ubuntu dot community is the road between places in the community, Discourse is the town hall. We highly recommend you set up an account over there and join the discussion.

There are categories set up for all of the core aspects of Ubuntu itself and some related projects; Desktop, server, foundations, multipass, security, WSL, documentation, etc. And there is a community category, where anyone can create a topic to talk about their community projects and engagements.

Discourse is **_not_** a support forum though. If you want to discuss, give feedback, or present your ideas about Ubuntu, or Ubuntu related projects, then Discourse is the place to go. For technical questions or any other questions about Ubuntu or other projects, go to the support page or the project's specific location.  

We use this site for discussions about Ubuntu, contribution, starting new projects, discussing the future, and much more. Ubuntu team members also post status reports, release notes, and other important information here.

## Launchpad

Launchpad is a software collaboration platform created by Canonical and is where _a lot_ of the Ubuntu project lives. Especially technical and historically technical things. There’s more information on [the Ubuntu wiki](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Launchpad)

If you’re interested in contributing to any or all of the following things it is worth setting up an account over there and requesting to join the relevant groups:

* [Answers](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Launchpad#Answers)
* [Bug Reports](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Launchpad#Bugs)
* [Ubuntu package building and hosting](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Launchpad#Ubuntu%20package%20building%20and%20hosting)
* [Blueprints](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Launchpad#Blueprints)
* [Translations](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Launchpad#Translations)
* [Code Hosting](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Launchpad#Code%20Hosting) using bazaar (not GitHub)

Here’s a tutorial to make it easy.
